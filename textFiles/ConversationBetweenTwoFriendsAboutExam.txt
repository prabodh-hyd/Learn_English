Harsha:  Hello Sai,  How are you?

Sai: I'm fine, thank you. What about you?

Harsha:  I'm also good, but I'm worried about my final examination.

Sai: Oh, OK. You are serious about your studies, so you are worried.

Harsha: I know. However, I am extremely concerned because I have not adequately prepared for the Hindi subject.

Sai: Oh, I believe you are a brilliant student.

Harsha: Yes, but I can't prepare well because I was at my brother's wedding.

Sai: Now what are you doing?

Harsha: One thing we will do. 

Sai: What?

Harsha: Can you help me with this subject? Once you help me, I can overcome this problem.

Sai: Yeah, sure. I will help you. You will come to my house. It is better to learn together and overcome your problem.

Harsha: Yes, Sai. This is the right idea. Thank you so much. 
 
Sai: Welcome, Harsha!"

Harsha: I hope you will prepare well for the examination.

Sai: Yes, and I need to revise it again.

Harsha: In this examination, you will get better marks.

Sai: I hope you get better grades as well.

Harsha: Ok.  I need to go home now.  See you tomorrow

Sai: ok, Byee

Harsha: Byee
